Sprint 1 

**User Stories**


**Backend User stories**

1. Customer Registration
- Design and implement a database schema for storing customer registration details.
- Develop an API to accept and store customer data in the database.
- Implement data validation to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Enforce password validation rules (e.g., length, complexity).

2. Customer Login
- Develop an API to authenticate customers by verifying their credentials.
- Implement JWT-based authentication to generate secure tokens upon successful login.
- Validate password security during login attempts.



**What issues your team planned to address?**\n
Our team planned to address the following key issues related to customer authentication and security:

  - Implementing a secure customer registration and login process.
  - Ensuring proper validation of customer data to maintain data integrity.
  - Implementing JWT-based authentication for session management.
  - Enhancing password security through validation mechanisms.
  - Designing an optimized database schema to efficiently store customer data.

**Which ones were successfully completed?**\n
We successfully completed the following tasks:


**Backend**\n
   Customer Registration:

  - Database schema for customer registration was created.
  - API for customer registration was implemented and successfully stores data in the database.
  - Customer data validation (format, required fields) was enforced.
  - Password validation rules (e.g., minimum length, special characters) were implemented.
    
  Customer Login:

  - API for customer login was implemented and verifies customer credentials.
  - JWT token is generated successfully upon login.
  - Password validation was enforced during the login process.

**Which ones didnâ€™t and why?**
  - Error handling and logging mechanisms may still need enhancements to capture invalid login attempts properly.
  Reason for Incomplete Tasks:
  - Some issues required further debugging and testing.
